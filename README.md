# PndAid

PndAid is a small PHP library for handling and interrogating Pnd files.

## Features

* Get file details (name, path, directory, extension, file size etc.)
* Basic Pnd file validation based on file extension and file type
* Find Pnd archive type (ISO|Squashfs)
* Find and extract the pXML data
* Find and extract the icon data
* Save the pXML to its own file
* Save the icon to its own file
* Ability to iterate over and seek to file data like an array
* Ability to list files in archive
* Ability to extract files from both pnd archive formats (ISO|Squashfs)
* Validate the PXML

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* 7z and squashfs-tools installed on your local environment (only tested on linux)

### Basic Usage

Instantiate a PndFile:
```PHP
$pnd = FileFactory::create('pnd','/path/to/foo.pnd');
```
Get the archive type:
```PHP
$fileType = $pnd->fileType();
```
Get the pXml as a string:
```PHP
$pxml = (string)$pnd->pxml;
```
Save the pXml to disk:
```PHP
$pnd->pxml->save('/path/to/pxml.xml');
```
Check if the PXML is valid
```PHP
if(!$pnd->pxml->isValid()){
    foreach($pnd->pxml->getPxmlErrors() as $e){
        echo $e;
    }
}
```
Get the icon as a string (not much use but still):
```PHP
$pxml = (string)$pnd->icon;
```
Save the icon to disk:
```PHP
$pnd->icon->save('/path/to/icon.png');
```
Find the position of something in the pnd binary
```PHP
$position = $pnd->findInFile('<package ');
```

Or Iterate over any file for any reason
```PHP
$fileIterator = new ReverseFileDataIterator('/path/to/file');
foreach ($fileIterator as $position => $data) {
    if (stripos($data, '<PXML ') !== false) {
        echo 'found at position: ' . $position + stripos($data, '<PXML ');
    }
}
```

When extracting files from ISO or Squashfs the directory structure is preserved
The ability to ignore directory structure could be implemented but I haven't

Extract preview pics from the pnd archive
```PHP
$position = $pnd->extractPreviewPics('/path/to/save/directory');
```

You can use this library to extract any file from ISO or Squashfs archives

Extract file from Squashfs archive, same method works for IsoArchiveExtractor
```PHP
$Extractor = new SquashfsArchiveExtractor('/path/to/foo.pnd');
$Extractor->extractFile('file1.png', '/dir/to/extract/to');
```
Extract many files from Squashfs archive, same method works for IsoArchiveExtractor
```PHP
$Extractor->extractFiles(['file1.png','run.sh'], '/dir/to/extract/to');
```
Extract all files from Squashfs archive, same method works for IsoArchiveExtractor
```PHP
$Extractor->extractAll('/dir/to/extract/to');
```
Get an array list all files from Squashfs archive, same method works for IsoArchiveExtractor
```PHP
$files = $Extractor->listContents();
```

### Unit Testing

The library is accompanied by passing unit tests. The library uses `phpunit` for testing.
