                BuMP3 is a MP3 content aggregator. In other words, if you specify an author name and a song name, it will crawl a number of services to find and download the appropriate file. Here are some of the additional features of Bump3:

                - will not download a song less than a certain length (default is 1MB; but it's adjustable),
                - will not download the same song twice (no duplicates option),
                - fast search results (can search an entire site in less than a second,
                - automatic downloading of songs once found,
                - playing of songs immediately after download begins (songs usually begin playing within seconds of searching),
                - which media player program to launch the partially-downloaded files to.

                Important Legal Note:
                This program is completely legal to download and execute.
                Downloading copyrighted materials is against the law in most countries.
                BuMP3 is not intended to be used to download copyrighted materials.
                The author of BuMP3 cannot be held responsible if this program is used to download illegal content.
