# PndAid

PndAid is a small PHP library for handling and interrogating Pnd files.

## Features

* Get file details (name, path, directory, extension, file size etc.)
* Basic Pnd file validation based on file extension and file type
* Find Pnd archive type (ISO|Squashfs)
* Find and extract the pXML data
* Find and extract the icon data
* Save the pXML to its own file
* Save the icon to its own file
* Ability to iterate over and seek to file data like an array
* Ability to list files in archive
* Ability to extract files from both pnd archive formats (ISO|Squashfs)

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

Instantiate a PndFile:
```PHP
$pnd = FileFactory::create('pnd','/path/to/foo.pnd');
```
Get the archive type:
```PHP
$fileType = $pnd->fileType();
```
Get the pXml as a string:
```PHP
$pxml = $pnd->Pxml->Data();
```
Save the pXml to disk:
```PHP
$pnd->Pxml->Save('/path/to/pxml.xml');
```
Get the icon as a string (not much use but still):
```PHP
$pxml = $pnd->Icon->Data();
```
Save the icon to disk:
```PHP
$pnd->Icon->Save('/path/to/icon.png');
```
Find the position of something in the pnd binary
```PHP
$position = $pnd->findInFile('<package ');
```
Or Iterate over any file for any reason
```PHP
$fileIterator = new ReverseFileDataIterator('/path/to/file');
foreach ($fileIterator as $position => $data) {
    if (stripos($data, '<PXML ') !== false) {
        echo 'found at position: ' . $position + stripos($data, '<PXML ');
    }
}
```
Extract file from iso archive (requires 7z being installed on your environment)
```PHP
$Extractor = new IsoArchiveExtractor('/path/to/foo.pnd');
$Extractor->extractFile('META-INF/MANIFEST.MF', '/dir/to/extract/to');
```
Extract file from squashfs archive (requires squashfs-tools being installed on your environment)
```PHP
$Extractor = new SquashfsArchiveExtractor('/path/to/foo.pnd');
$Extractor->extractFile('META-INF/MANIFEST.MF', '/dir/to/extract/to');
```
